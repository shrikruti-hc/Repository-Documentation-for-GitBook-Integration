This document provides simple instructions on how to organize your content in a GitHub repository so that GitBook can read it effectively. It also includes guidelines for creating a clear navigation structure.
### 1. Structuring Your Content
To ensure that GitBook can read your content, follow these steps:

   - Include a short description of the documentation and provide any important links that might be useful. These links could lead to the a website, related resources, or any other related materials.

#### 1.2 Organize Your Content
* **Create a docs Folder:**
Make a folder in your repository to store all your documentation files, like guides and instructions. This helps keep everything organized and makes it easy for anyone to find and work on the documentation.

   - Choose the repository where you want to create a folder.
   - On the left sidebar, you’ll see the “Create new file” button. Click on it.
   - Enter the folder name with the format name/. Make sure to include the slash at the end.
   - On the right side of the page, you’ll see the Commit new file button. Click on it to create the folder.

* **Use Markdown Files:**
   - Create `.md` files for each section of your documentation.
   - Name your files clearly `(e.g., introduction.md, installation.md, etc)`.
 
* **Index File:**
   - Create a file named `SUMMARY.md` in the folder.
   - This file will outline the structure of your documentation.

### 2. Creating a Clear Navigation Structure

#### 2.1 Use the SUMMARY.md File
The `SUMMARY.md` file is important for navigation. It defines the chapters and sections of your documentation. Here’s how to set it up:
* Basic Structure
   - Start with a header for your documentation.
   - List the main sections and their respective files.

#### 2.2 Keep It Logical and Simple
* **Group Related Content:** Place similar topics together.
* **Use Clear Titles:** Ensure titles are descriptive and easy to understand.
* **Limit Levels:** Try to keep navigation to a maximum of three levels deep to avoid confusion.

### 3. Final Checklist
* Repository is set up with a `README.md`.
* Folder is created.
* All content is in markdown files within the folder.
* `SUMMARY.md` is created and correctly lists all sections.

By following these instructions, you will create a well-organized GitHub repository that GitBook can easily read, offering a clear and user-friendly documentation experience.
