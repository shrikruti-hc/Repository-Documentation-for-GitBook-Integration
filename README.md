## 1. How to Create a GitHub Account

GitHub is a platform where you can store and collaborate on code. Follow these steps to create an account:

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1. Visit GitHub: Go to (https://github.com).
2. Sign Up: Click on the Sign Up button.&#x20;
3. Enter Details: Fill in your username, email address, and a password.&#x20;
4. Verify Email: GitHub will send a verification email to the address you provided. Click the link in the email to verify your account.&#x20;
5. Choose a Plan: Select a free plan or a paid plan, depending on your needs.&#x20;
6. Complete Setup: Follow the on-screen instructions to complete your profile setup, including selecting your interests and confirming your account. Once your GitHub account is created, you can start creating repositories, collaborate on projects, and push your code.

## 2. How to Create a GitBook Account

GitBook is a platform for creating and hosting documentation. Here’s how to create an account:

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1. Visit GitBook: Go to (https://www.gitbook.com).
2. Sign Up: Click on Sign Up in the top-right corner.&#x20;
3. Sign Up with GitHub: You can sign up quickly using your GitHub account by clicking on the Sign Up with GitHub button. If you prefer to use a different email, click on Sign Up with Email.&#x20;
4. Fill in Details: If signing up with email, enter your name, email address, and create a password.&#x20;
5. Verify Email: GitBook will send you a confirmation email. Click the link to verify your email address.&#x20;
6. Complete Profile: After signing up, GitBook will guide you to complete your profile. You can set up your first space (project) to start adding documentation. Once your GitBook account is created, you can start creating, editing, and managing documentation spaces, as well as integrate them with your GitHub repositories.

Now that you have both GitHub and GitBook accounts, you're all set to create a space in GitBook and connect it to your personal GitHub repository.
